**Overview** : The course project is based on the Home Credit Default Risk (HCDR) Kaggle Competition. The goal of this project is to predict whether or not a client will repay a loan. In order to make sure that people who struggle to get loans due to insufficient or non-existent credit histories have a positive loan experience, Home Credit makes use of a variety of alternative data--including telco and transactional information--to predict their clients' repayment abilities.


**Abstract**
The objective of this project is to use machine learning methodologies on historical loan application data to predict whether or not an applicant will be able to repay a loan. As an extension to EDA and hyper-tuned model, this phase provided valuable insights when feature engineering was modified to handle data leakage employing a better data processing flow. Multiple experiments were conducted applying feature selection techniques including RFE, SelecKbest, Variance threshold to Logistic regression, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM & SVM models , further handling class imbalance using SMOTE for XGBoost , monitoring error generalization with early stopping and building high performance Neural Networks . Our results in this phase show that the best performing algorithm was Logistic Regerssion with varaince threshold selection with test ROC_AOC as 75.22%. The lowest performing was SVM model with test AUC(Area under ROC) as 67.21%. Our best score in Kaggle submission was for Logistic Regression with SelectKBest with score of 0.72158 for private and 0.72592 for public.
